# OOP Chess Game

## Description
This project is a simple browser-based chess game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The game runs entirely in the browser without the need for any backend server.

## Features
- Dynamically generated 8x8 chessboard.
- Piece classes for different chess pieces.
- Basic move logic for pawns (extendable to all pieces).
- Turn switching between White and Black.
- Click-based piece selection and movement.
- Highlighting of legal moves.
- Fully contained in a single HTML file.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
3. Play chess directly in the browser.

## Controls
- **Click** on a piece to select it.
- **Click** on a highlighted square to move the piece.
- The game automatically switches turns between White and Black.

## Notes
- Currently, only pawns have movement logic implemented.
- You can extend the `Piece` subclasses to implement other chess pieces.
